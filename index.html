    <h1>Devepment, Strategy and Technology</h1>
    <h3>Mobile Friendly, Fully Functional, Affordable Website</h3>

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
    <p>The Website will look wonderful in all types of devices. Whether the users are on tablets, desktops or even
        smartphones
        . I use a responsive framework so that I can design a website that will fit on any screen-sizes. With this,
        the content's presentation in any device can be controlled.
    </p>
    <h3>WordPress Development</h3>
    <p>WordPress Development is my bread and butter. This powerful CMS has a huge database, and it is easy to
        manage. It has the latest web building technology to ensure the stability and security of every content in the
        webpage. I customize WordPress and implement well-commented, organized and clean codes to meet my clients'
        personal and business objectives.
    </p>
    <h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>
    <p>The search engine is a game changer and nowadays it is a must have for websites to be included in the top of
        search engine results. I only use clean and valid HTML5 and CSS3 codes so the search engine will be able to
        index
        the website contents with ease. I'll provide SEO tools in the website to increase the number of visitors and
        make it search engine friendly.
